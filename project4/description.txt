A bunch of Voltorbs are falling out of the sky and it's up to the Illuminati (you) to stop them!
Voltorbs will destroy your temples and your missile batteries if they reach the bottom of the screen.
Use your Illuminati missiles to blow up the Voltorbs by clicking.
Shooting the green ball that moves horizontally across the screen calls forth the power of the Illuminati and reloads all your missiles.
